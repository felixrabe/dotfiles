Nothing but a simple, stripped down set of `vim` configuration files.

# Key Features

- Mouse support
- Nice-looking but unobtrusive theming
- Support for many common languages (and also SML)
- Syntax/error checking

# Key keybindings (mostly insert mode only)
- Comment/uncomment a line with `gcc` (`gc` when selecting text in visual mode)
- Search with `/` or `Ctrl+f` and clear search result highlighting with `Esc Esc`
- Type `U` to undo and `R` to redo
- Type ` u` to see your undo history (yes, with a space)
- Type ` n` to open a file explorer tree (yes, with a space again)


Note: Some of these exist in vanilla Vim. I just wanted to highlight them.
